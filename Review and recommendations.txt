After going through the code here's my review and recommendation

REVIEW
-Hardcoded encryption key (vulnarable to reverse engineering)
-Temporary Exposure of sensitive data (Notepad when decrypting)
-Weak Xor Encryption
-Error handling and Validation
-System call(system) risks issues: system("notepad password.txt") is vulnerable to command injection

Recommendations
-Minimize privileges: ensure the progeam runs with the least privileges required
-Avoid hardcoded credentials: Dynamically prompt for or securely generate keys
-Input Validation: Ensure all user inputs are validated
-Use secure libraries: Replace custom XOR Encryption with Libraries like Crypto+ or OPENSSL
-Secure file handling: Avoid exposing plaintext files
-Overwrite sensitive data in memory defore deletion.
